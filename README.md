First Website I Created Following Along on Treehouse

Created this simple portfolio site following along with Treehouse. It was a good starting point and it has helped me with my current project, 
acting as a reference when I'm stuck or can't find the answer online. 

You can view the site by simply opening the index.html file. I'm not currently hosting the site live, but maybe in the future when I get time 
to go back and add some new things that I have learned.
